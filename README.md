- styles.css

The styles.css contains all the css code that is implemented into each of the different htmls. The website first starts in the index.html which then there's a button that leads to home.html. From there there are multiple buttons each bringing you to a different html cite. If the user wants to go back to the page they were previously on there's a button on the page that'll bring them back.
